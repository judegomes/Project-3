The hstory of accounting or accountancy can be
 traced to ancient civilizations.[1][2][3]

The early development of accounting dates to
 ancient Mesopotamia, and is closely related to developments in writing, counting and money[1][4][5] and early auditing systems by the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians.[2] By the time of the Roman Empire, the government had access to detailed financial information.[6]

In India Chanakya wrote s manuscript similar 
to a financial management book, during the
 period of the Mauryan Empire. His book 
 "Arthashasthra" contains few detailed 
 aspects of maintaining books of accounts for a Sovereign State.

The Italian Luca Pacioli, recognized as The 
Father of accounting and bookkeeping was the first person to publish a work on double-entry bookkeeping, and introduced the field in Italy.[7][8]

The modern profession of the chartered accountant 
originated in Scotland in the nineteenth century.
 Accountants often belonged to the same associations
 as solicitors, who often offered accounting services 
 to their clients. Early modern accounting had similarities
 to today's forensic accounting. Accounting began to 
 transition into an organized profession in the 
 nineteenth century,[9] with local professional 
 bodies in England merging to form the Institute
 of Chartered Accountants 
in England and Wales in 1880.[10]
